# 🌱 LatticeOS — Architecture for Connection

**Revive. Repurpose. Reconnect.**

LatticeOS is a lightweight Linux-based operating system designed to breathe new life into legacy and upcycled hardware. Built with care, minimalism, and a DIY spirit, it's more than an OS — it's a movement.

We believe computing should be human-first, accessible, and sustainable. LatticeOS empowers individuals to reclaim their devices, reconnect with purpose, and run intelligent systems even on machines that were left behind.
